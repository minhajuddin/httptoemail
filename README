HTTP to Email
=============

  - Provide a url like httptoemail.minhajuddin.com/:sha512hash which will then send an email to
    the registered email id when a post is made

  - To start run `PGURL='postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/dbname' ./httptoemail`

  - To create the tables run:
      
      CREATE TABLE users(id VARCHAR(128) PRIMARY KEY, email VARCHAR(100))
